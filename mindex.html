                <h1>Munchkins</h1>
                <p>The Munchkin is a relatively new breed of cat characterized by its very short legs, which are caused by a
                    genetic mutation. Much controversy erupted over the breed when it was recognized by The International
                    Cat Association in 1995 with critics voicing concern over potential health and mobility issues.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Munchkin is generally described as a sweet-natured, playful, people-oriented, outgoing and intelligent
                    cat which responds well to being handled. Some sources state that the shortness of their legs does not
                    interfere with their running and leaping abilities, while others state their ability to jump is limited
                    by their condition.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Munchkin has similar characteristics to normal domestic cats, due to their frequent use as outcrosses.
                    It is a small to medium-sized cat with a moderate body type and medium-plush coat. Male Munchkins typically
                    weigh between 6 and 9 pounds &#40;3â€“4 kg&#41; and are usually larger than female Munchkins, which typically
                    weigh between 4 and 8 pounds. The hind legs can be slightly longer than the front which creates a slight
                    rise from the shoulder to the rump. The legs of the Munchkin may be slightly bowed, although excessive
                    bowing is a disqualification in the show ring. Cow-hocked legs are also penalized.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Munchkin comes in all coat colors and patterns. It also comes in a long-haired variety, which is shown
                    in a separate Munchkin Longhair category. The short-haired variety has a medium-plush coat while the
                    long-haired has a semi-long silky coat. TICA rules for outcrossing allows the use of any domestic cat
                    that does not already belong to a recognized breed. Similarity to other breeds is grounds for disqualification.
                    Non-standard Munchkins are not allowed to be shown.
